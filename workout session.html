As a beginner, you can progress very quickly because almost any exercise promotes muscle and strength gains. Still, it's important to avoid overexertion, which can lead to injuries or decreased performance.
                 This workout routine has you in the gym 3 days per week (such as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with full to body sessions completed each day. This allows you to get used to new movements, focus on proper form, and take time to recover. </dd>

	 <div class="hello">
	 <div id="div2">
            <div id="paragraphs"> It's not only six to pack seekers who should be paying their abs plenty of attention when they visit the gym. Strong abs are an integral part of a rock to solid core, which should be one of the goals of any fitness regime.
                             That's because a strong core is the foundation upon which so many other things rest  to  whether that's good posture that helps to prevent lower back pain developing from sitting at a desk all day, or the mobility and strength required to excel in sports and other activities ranging all the way from athletics to zumba.
                             Forming a mighty midriff will also help you perform better when doing all manner of other moves in the gym. Powerhouse lifts like barbell squats and deadlifts all demand a strong core, as do agility workouts and plyometric exercises. </div>

	<h3 class="headings4"> 30 Days HIIT challenge </h3>
	 <div class="hello">
	 <div id="div2">
            <div id="paragraphs"> HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise alternated with low intensity recovery periods. Interestingly, it is perhaps the most time to efficient way to exercise.
                             Typically, a HIIT workout will be 10 to 30 minutes in duration.
                             Despite how short the workout is, it can produce health benefits similar to twice as much moderate to intensity exercise .
                             The actual activity being performed varies but can include sprinting, biking, jumping rope, or other bodyweight exercises.
                             For example, a HIIT workout using a stationary bike could consist of 30 seconds of cycling as fast as possible with high resistance, followed by several minutes of slow, easy cycling with low resistance.
                             This would be considered one “round” or “repetition” of HIIT, and you would typically complete 4 to 6 reps in one workout.
                             The specific amount of time you exercise and recover will vary based on the activity you choose and how intensely you are exercising.
                             Regardless of how you implement this strategy, high intensity intervals should involve short periods of vigorous exercise that make your heart rate speed up.
                             HIIT not only provides the benefits of longer to duration exercise in a much shorter amount of time but also may provide some unique health benefits. </div>

	<h3 class="headings4"> 30 Days Full Body challenge </h3>
	 <div class="hello">
	 <div id="div2">
            <div id="paragraphs"> To add as much lean muscle mass as possible over the next 28 days, while also stripping off body fat, it's important you follow this training plan as closely as possible. It's been designed to tax your major muscle groups, especially your chest and back, to radically transform how you look shirtless.
                             The four to week plan is made up of four sessions a week, which you will ideally do on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.
                             The Monday session targets your chest and back; the Wednesday one your legs and shoulders; the Friday session your chest and triceps; and the Saturday one your back and biceps.
                             This means you'll work your major upper to body muscles either directly or indirectly twice a week, and it's this big increase in training volume that will stimulate these muscles into growing bigger quickly. </div>

	<h3 class="headings4"> 30 Days ABS challenge </h3>
	 <div class="hello">
	 <div id="div2">
            <div id="paragraphs"> In general, we're all about the long term when it comes to fitness. Getting in shape can take a long time, and keeping yourself in shape is the work of a lifetime. However, there's a lot to be gained from short to term challenges and goals as well. Not only are they a great way to kick to start your fitness and motivation, but you can also achieve an astonishing amount in just 30 days.
                             This 30 to day abs challenge is the perfect example of those benefits. If you follow each of the workouts closely, you'll finish the month with a stronger core and more defined abs. Whether they'll be defined enough to class as a six to pack is hard to say  to  what you do in the kitchen is a big part of that  to  but we can promise more definition, better posture and improved mobility.
                             This challenge not only targets all parts of the abdominals but also works your core endurance, says Folarin.  It builds in intensity, allowing you to notice your improvements every day, until you have mastered each exercise by day 30.</div>

    <h3 class="headings4"> 60 Days Full Body challenge </h3>
	 <div class="hello">
	 <div id="div2">
            <div id="paragraphs"> A lot of guys go into the gym, push it as hard as they can for days or weeks at a time, then slow down when they either start to feel burned out or find themselves hampered by nagging injuries. Of course, there's a better way to train to avoid muscular and central nervous system burnout.
                             This plan is that better way and was formulated by one of the most respected individuals in the fitness industry, James Grage, co to founder and executive vice president of BPI Sports in Hollywood, FL. Grage isn't just a successful businessman, he's also a gym rat in the trenches who's been pounding the iron for decades with a shredded physique to show for it.
                             Grage accomplished this with a program design element that elite athletes have been following forever: alternating between heavy and light workouts. Every heavy day is either followed by a light or rest day. This promotes recovery so that you don't burn yourself out with too many difficult workouts in one week.A bigger, stronger, leaner, and more injury to resistant body can be yours in just 60 days, and it all starts here. </div>
