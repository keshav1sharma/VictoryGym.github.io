		   All you need to do is start eating right food. However, in India, this can
		   feel like an insurmountable challenge, given our food culture and dietary
		   habits.For instance, a typical Indian meal is high in carbohydrates and
		   sugar.We eat a lot of potatoes, rice, and sweets. <br> <br> We also love our snacks
		   and can&apos;t imagine a day without our fix of namkeens and bhujias. Even we
		   encourage our friends and family into eating more, as a sign of hospitality
		   and affection, and consider refusing, an extra helping a rebuff. To top it
		   all, we&apos;ve never embraced physical exercise as essential. So, it isn&apos;t a
		   surprise that India is battling with a growing problem of obesity. <br> <br>
		   But, the answer doesn&apos;t lie in shunning Indian food in favour of foreign
		   ingredients or fad diets. Moreover, you&apos;ll find that the best Indian diet
		   plan consists of foods that you&apos;ve already got in your kitchen and which
		   will enable you to lose weight by making a few changes to your diet

			  <p class= "para content">
			     A lot can be spoken about what goes into an ideal diet chart. However, one&apos;s nutritional requirement varies based on various factors. It could change depending on gender, for example, male dietary requirements vary from that of a female.<br><br>
                 Geography can play a role as well, with North Indian diets being largely different from South Indian ones. So, here meal preferences come into play since the consumption of food by a vegetarian or a vegan differ largely from that by a non-vegetarian.<br><br>
                 However, we have put together a diet plan ideal for weight loss with Indian food. This 7 day diet plan also known as a 1200 calorie diet plan is a sample, and should not be followed by any individual without consulting a nutritionist.

	             <h2 class= "shcolor"><li>Cut back on refined carbs</li>
		         </h2>
	             <p> One way to lose weight quickly is to cut back on sugars and starches, or carbohydrates. This could be with a low carb eating plan or by reducing refined carbs and replacing them with whole grains. <br>
                     When you do that, your hunger levels go down, and you generally end up eating fewer calories (1Trusted Source). <br>
                     With a low carb eating plan, you&apos;ll utilize burning stored fat for energy instead of carbs.<br>
                     If you choose to eat more complex carbs like whole grains along with a calorie deficit, you&apos;ll benefit from higher fiber and digest them more slowly. This makes them more filling to keep you satisfied. <br>
	             </p>

			     <h2 class= "shcolor"><li> Protein </li>
		         </h2>
				 <p>
			        Eating a recommended amount of protein is essential to help preserve your health and muscle mass while losing weight (5Trusted Source). <br>
                    Evidence suggests that eating adequate protein may improve cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite, and body weight, (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).<br>
                    Here&apos;s how to determine how much you need to eat without eating too much. Many factors determine your specific needs, but generally, an average person needs (9Trusted Source):<br>

				        <li> <b>46-75</b>  grams per day for the average female</li> <br>

			         </ul>

				 <p>Diets with adequate protein can also help:

				     <ul type= "disc" >

       	                 <li> reduce cravings and obsessive thoughts about food by 60%</li> <br>
				         <li> reduce the desire to snack late at night by half</li> <br>
				         <li> make you feel full <br>
			         </ul>

			     <h2 class= "shcolor"><li>Low carb and leafy green vegetables</li>
		         </h2>
	             <p>
			        Don&apos;t be afraid to load your plate with leafy green vegetables. They&apos;re packed with nutrients, and you can eat very large amounts without greatly increasing calories and carbs.
	             </p>

			     <h2 class= "shcolor"><li>Healthy fats</li>
		         </h2>
	             <p>
			           Don&apos;t be afraid of eating fats.
                       Your body still requires healthy fats no matter what eating plan you choose. Olive oil and avocado oil are great choices for including in your eating plan.
                       Other fats such as butter and coconut oil should be used only in moderation due to their higher saturated fat content (12Trusted Source).<br><br>

		          </h2>
	              <p>
			          You may lose 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) of weight, sometimes more, in the first week of a diet plan and then lose weight consistently after that. The first week is usually a loss of both body fat and water weight.<br>
			          If you&apos;re new to dieting, weight loss may happen more quickly. The more weight you have to lose, the faster you&apos;ll lose it.<br>
			          Unless your doctor suggests otherwise, losing 1 to 2 pounds per week is usually a safe amount. If you&apos;re trying to lose weight faster than that, speak to your doctor about a safe level of calorie reduction.<br>

	  </h1>

	    <p class= "para content"> Bodybuilding is centered around building your body&apos;s muscles through weightlifting and nutrition.<br><br>
           Whether recreational or competitive, bodybuilding is often referred to as a lifestyle, as it involves both the time you spend in and outside the gym.<br><br>
		   In order to maximize your results from the gym, you must focus on your diet, as eating the wrong foods can be detrimental to your bodybuilding goals.<br><br>
		   Daily calorie needs range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for adult women and 2,000 to 3,000 calories for adult men.
        </p> <br><br>

    <!--  points  -->

	   <ul type= "disc">

	      <h2 class= "shcolor"><li>Calorie Needs and Macronutrients</li>
		  </h2>

	         <p>The goal for competitive bodybuilders is to increase muscle mass in the bulking phase and reduce body fat in the cutting phase. Hence, you consume more calories in the bulking phase than in the cutting phase.
	         </p>

	      <h2 class= "shcolor"><li>How Many Calories Do You Need?</li>
		  </h2>

			 <p>The easiest way to determine how many calories you need is to weigh yourself at least three times a week and record what you eat using a calorie tracking app.<br><br>
                If your weight stays the same, the daily number of calories you eat is your maintenance calories, in other words, you&apos;re not losing or gaining weight, but maintaining it.<br><br>
                During your bulking phase, it&apos;s recommended to increase your calorie intake by 15%. For example, if your maintenance calories are 3,000 per day, you should eat 3,450 calories per day (3,000 x 0.15 = 450) during your bulking phase (6Trusted Source).<br><br>
                When transitioning from a bulking to a cutting phase, you would instead decrease your maintenance calories by 15%, meaning you would eat 2,550 calories per day instead of 3,450.<br><br>
                As you gain weight in the bulking phase or lose weight in the cutting phase, you will need to adjust your calorie intake at least monthly to account for changes in your weight.<br><br>
                Increase your calories as you gain weight in the bulking phase and decrease your calories as you lose weight in the cutting phase for continued progression.<br><br>
                During either phase, it&apos;s recommended not to lose or gain more than 0.5 to 1% of your body weight per week. This ensures that you don&apos;t lose too much muscle during the cutting phase or gain too much body fat during the bulking phase (7Trusted Source).

		  <h2 class= "shcolor"><li>Bodybuilding Nutrition: Foods to Eat and Avoid</li>
		  </h2>

			 <p>Like training, diet is a vital part of bodybuilding.<br><br>
                Eating the right foods in the appropriate amounts provides your muscles with the nutrients they need to recover from workouts and grow bigger and stronger.<br><br>
                Conversely, consuming the wrong foods or not consuming enough of the right ones will leave you with subpar results.<br><br>

		</h1>



			  <p class= "para content">
			     For some people, gaining weight or adding muscle can be just as difficult as losing weight is for others<br><br>
                 However, simply adding certain foods to your diet can make your weight gain efforts both healthy and more effective.<br><br>
				 A 2,000-calorie diet is considered standard and meets the nutritional needs of most people.<br><br>
                 However, depending on your activity level, body size, and goals, you may need more.

	         <h2 class= "shcolor"><li> Homemade protein smoothies</li>
		     </h2>

	         <p>
			    Drinking homemade protein smoothies can be a highly nutritious and quick way to gain weight.<br>
				Making your own smoothies is the best way since commercial versions are often full of sugar and lack nutrients. It also gives you full control over the flavor and nutrient content.<br>
				Here are just a few tasty variations you can try. You can combine each with 2 cups (470 mL) of dairy milk or soy milk if you have lactose intolerance. Both have more nutrients and calories than other alternative milks.
			 </p>
			     <ul type= "disc" >

       	            <li> <b>Chocolate banana nut shake: </b>Combine 1 banana, 1 scoop of chocolate whey protein, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of peanut or another nut butter.</li> <br>
				    <li> <b>Vanilla berry shake:</b> Combine 1 cup (237 mL) of fresh or frozen mixed berries, ice, 1 cup (237 mL) of high protein, full fat Greek yogurt, and 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein.</li> <br>
					<li> <b>Chocolate hazelnut shake: </b>Combine 15 ounces (444 mL) of chocolate milk with 1 scoop of chocolate whey protein, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of hazelnut butter, and 1 avocado.</li> <br>
					<li> <b>Caramel apple shake: </b>Combine 1 sliced apple, 1 cup (237 mL) of full fat Greek yogurt, 1 scoop of caramel- or vanilla-flavored whey protein, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of sugar-free caramel sauce or flavoring.</li> <br>
					<li> <b>Vanilla blueberry shake: </b>Combine 1 cup (237 mL) of fresh or frozen blueberries, 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein, 1 cup (237 mL) of vanilla Greek yogurt, and sweetener if needed.</li> <br>
					<li> <b>Super green shake: </b>Combine 1 cup (237 mL) of spinach, 1 avocado, 1 banana, 1 cup (237 mL) of pineapple, and 1 scoop of unflavored or vanilla whey protein.</li> <br>


			     </ul>

			 <h2 class= "shcolor"><li> Milk </li>
		     </h2>

	         <p>
			    Milk has been used as a weight gainer or muscle builder for decades.<br><br>
				It provides a good balance of proteins, carbs, and fats and is a good source of calcium, as well as other vitamins and minerals (2Trusted Source).<br><br>
				For those trying to add more muscle, milk is an excellent protein source that provides both casein and whey proteins. Research has even shown it can help you add muscle when combined with weightlifting (3).<br><br>
				Additionally, studies have found that milk, or whey and casein combined, can lead to greater mass gain than other protein sources (4).<br><br>
				Try drinking one or two glasses of whole milk (149 calories per cup) as a snack, with a meal, or before and after a workout if you&apos;re training (5Trusted Source).<br><br>
				Milk smoothies are also a delicious way to add milk to your diet. For an easy morning protein boost, try blending up 1 cup of frozen berries, 1 cup of whole milk, 2 teaspoons of honey, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla (about 275 calories).
			 </p>

			 <h2 class= "shcolor"><li> Rice </li>
		     </h2>

				 <p>
				     Rice is a convenient, low cost carb source to help you gain weight. Just 1 cup (158 grams) of cooked white rice provides 204 calories, 44 grams of carbs, and very little fat (6Trusted Source).<br><br>
                     Rice is also fairly calorie-dense, meaning you can easily obtain a high amount of carbs and calories from a single serving. This helps you eat more food, especially if you have a poor appetite or get full quickly.
				 </p>


			 <h2 class= "shcolor"><li>Nuts and nut butters</li>
		     </h2>

	         <p>
			 Nuts and nut butters are perfect choices if you&apos;re looking to gain weight.
			 Just one small handful of raw almonds (1/4 cup) contains 170 calories, 6 grams of protein, 4 grams of fiber, and 15 grams of healthy fats (7Trusted Source).<br><br>
			 Since nuts are very calorie-dense, just two handfuls per day with a meal or as a snack can quickly add hundreds of calories.<br><br>
			 You can add nut butters to a variety of snacks or dishes, such as smoothies, yogurts, and crackers, to turn them into a high calorie snack in no time.

			 </p>

			 <h2 class= "shcolor"><li>Potatoes and starches</li>
		    </h2>

	         <p>
			    Potatoes and other starchy foods are a very easy and cost-effective way to add in extra calories. <br><br>
			    <b>Try to choose one of these healthy sources of starchy carbs:</b>
	         </p>

			 <ul type= "disc">
			    <li>oats</li>
                <li>corn</li>
                <li>potatoes and sweet-potatoes</li>
